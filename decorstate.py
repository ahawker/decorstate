class Transition(object):
    """
    Object that implements the descriptor protocol to define a transition between two states of a machine.

    Transitions are defined as a decorated methods on an instance method.

    Transitions may also define three additional decorated methods to be called during specific phases of a transition.
    The following are supported:
        @transition.guard -- Callable to return a `bool` that determines if the transition should execute.
        @transition.before -- Callable to be invoked before starting the transition.
        @transition.after -- Callable to be invoked after completing the transition.
        @transition.exit -- Callable to be invoked before the next transition is invoked to change machine state.

    Example:

    Let's take the example of a simple light switch.

    import decorstate

    class LightSwitch(object):
        state = 'off'

        @decorstate.transition('off', 'on')
        def on(self, *args, **kwargs):
